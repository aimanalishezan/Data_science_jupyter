During training, Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero at each update cycle. This prevents the model from becoming overly reliant on any specific neurons, which encourages the network to learn more robust features that generalize better to unseen data.\n","\n","**Key points:**\n","- Dropout is only applied during training, not during inference.\n","- The dropout rate is a hyperparameter that determines the fraction of neurons to drop.\n","\n","\n","#### Batch Normalization\n","\n","Batch Normalization is a technique used to improve the training stability and speed of neural networks. It normalizes the output of a previous layer by re-centering and re-scaling the data, which helps in stabilizing the learning process. By reducing the internal covariate shift (the changes in the distribution of layer inputs), batch normalization allows the model to use higher learning rates, which often speeds up convergence.\n","\n","**Key Points:**\n","\n","- Batch normalization works by normalizing the inputs to each layer to have a mean of zero and a variance of one.\n","- It is applied during both training and inference, although its behavior varies slightly between the two phases.\n","- Batch normalization layers also introduce two learnable parameters that allow the model to scale and - shift the normalized output, which helps in restoring the model's representational power.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8e7da9c-bada-431e-a5f1-ca4d1eb35197","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["**Example of adding a Dropout layer in Keras:**\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"21e23cf5-ef9c-4701-8de5-870fe5305c83","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout, Dense, Input\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n\n# Define the input layer\ninput_layer = Input(shape=(20,))\n\n# Add a hidden layer\nhidden_layer = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)\n\n# Add a Dropout layer\ndropout_layer = Dropout(rate=0.5)(hidden_layer)\n\n# Add another hidden layer after Dropout\nhidden_layer2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(dropout_layer)\n\n# Define the output layer\noutput_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(hidden_layer2)\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)\n\n# Summary of the model\nmodel.summary()\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b384190b-ed08-41a6-8786-2bcd7b309921","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["**Example of adding Batch Normalization in Keras:**\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"679a4d2c-19bd-4d29-b78e-8b5cf6d4e074","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization, Dense, Input\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n\n# Define the input layer\ninput_layer = Input(shape=(20,))\n\n# Add a hidden layer\nhidden_layer = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)\n\n# Add a BatchNormalization layer\nbatch_norm_layer = BatchNormalization()(hidden_layer)\n\n# Add another hidden layer after BatchNormalization\nhidden_layer2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(batch_norm_layer)\n\n# Define the output layer\noutput_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(hidden_layer2)\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)\n\n# Summary of the model\nmodel.summary()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8b10de4-bfc4-459e-8b1a-ba4eee7e9b9c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Practice exercises\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"95df2827-1728-4d09-bc04-22f7450ae8b4","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#### Exercise 1: Add Dropout Layers\n","\n","**Objective:** Learn to add dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","1.
